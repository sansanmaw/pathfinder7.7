# pathfinder7.7
Final Project of Data Structures and Algorithm Course [May, 2025] [Authors: Ei Mon Soe, San San Maw]

# Project Description 

**Based on the heartbreaking earthquake with Magnitude 7.7 on the Richter scale happened in Myanmar in March, 2025, Pathfinder7.7 id developed as a Disaster Relief Resource Management System solution built in Python using basic data structures including:**

Linked List – to manage(add,delete) donation entries

Priority Queue – to operate disaster reports based on urgency

Dijkstra’s Algorithm – to find the shortest way from donation point to disaster locations.

**How to run the code for Pathfinder 7.7**

The system allows users to:

Add and manage donations.

Report disaster locations and urgency.

Simulate dispatching and logistics operations.
