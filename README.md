# pathfinders 7.7
Final Project of Data Structures and Algorithm Course [May, 2025] [Authors: Ei Mon Soe, San San Maw]

# Project Description 

**Based on the heartbreaking earthquake with Magnitude 7.7 on the Richter scale happened in Myanmar in March, 2025, Pathfinders 7.7 id developed as a Disaster Relief Resource Management System solution built in Python using basic data structures including:**

_Linked List_ – to manage(add,delete) donation entries

_Priority Queue_– to operate disaster reports based on urgency

_Dijkstra’s Algorithm_ – to find the shortest way from donation point to disaster locations.

# How to run the code for Pathfinders 7.7

The system allows users to:

Add and manage donations.

Report disaster locations and urgency.

Simulate dispatching and logistics operations.
